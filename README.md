# Module 11 - Web Scraping

The assignment for this module is comprised of two parts. Part 1 involves scraping 'Mars News' from a website, and this has been completed in the Jupyter Notebook named 'part_1_mars_news.ipynb'. Part 2 of the assignment consists of scraping and analysing Mars weather data from a table on the web. Part 2 of the assignment was completed in a Jupyter Notebook called 'part_2_mars_weather.ipynb'. The charts created from the analysis have been saved to the 'output' folder as PNG files. The scraped table with the Mars weather data has been saved to a CSV file in the 'resources' folder.

As the assignment is on Jupyter Notebooks, the analysis, explanations and code annotation can all be found within the Jupyter Notebook.
